Symbol-level precision (exact methods/classes, not just files)\n2. Actionability first (prioritize immediately executable code)\n3. Multiple valid answers (recognize alternatives)\n4. Essential coverage (implementation + domain + context)\n\nEvaluation Dimensions:\n- Essential Coverage: Does top-5 include all three categories?\n- Actionability: Average utility score (methods=10, classes=9, docs=6)\n- Precision: Found exact symbols mentioned?"
